    "QUES 1:Explain the key features of Python that make it a popular choice for programming.?\n",
    "ANS 1:Python's combination of readability, simplicity, versatility, and a strong community has contributed to its widespread adoption and popularity across various fields. • Clear Syntax: Python provides code readability with its clean and consistent syntax, making it easier to write and understand code. • Indentation: Python uses whitespace indentation to define code blocks and reducing potential errors. • Flexibility: Developers don't need to specify data types beforehand, saving time and effort. • Time Savings: Developers can use existing modules instead of writing code from scratch. • Code Organization: Python supports OOP concepts like classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism, promoting modular and reusable code. • Multiple Domains: Python is used in web development, data science, machine learning, scientific computing, automation, and more. • Adaptability: Its flexibility allows it to be applied to a wide range of applications. • Rapid Development: Developers can write code faster compared to lower-level languages."

    "ANS2:Keywords are reserved words in Python that have special meanings and are used to control the structure and logic of a program. Keywords like def, class, if, else, for, while are used to define functions, classes, conditional statements, and loops, respectively. Keywords like break, continue, return are used to modify the execution flow of a program. keywords like None, True, False represent specific data types. Keywords like try, except, finally, raise are used to handle errors and exceptions gracefully. Keywords like import, from, global, nonlocal have specific roles in importing modules, declaring global and nonlocal variables, etc."
